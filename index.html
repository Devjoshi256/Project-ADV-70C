          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">School will reopen with a difference. All required measures have been put into place to ensure
a safe environment.
I) Graded opening is planned: Students of classes 9- 12, who wish to meet their teachers must
send written permission from their parents to visit school. The same applies to those coming for
Science practicals & Cambridge Board Exams.
Some of the measures are enumerated below:
1. Mandatory temperature checks - have been ensured at entry points: the school gates and
during working hours in the M.I. Room.
2. Entry at the school gates will be monitored - No entry is permitted without face masks. In
case of fever or any relevant symptoms, no entry will be permitted. Particulars will be
entered in the register for record purposes if required for contact tracing. Hands are to be
sanitized with 70% alcohol based hand rub at entry.
3. Regular Sanitization of all Class rooms & campus with solution of Sodium Hypochlorite is
conducted throughout the day. Students are advised also to carry their own sanitizers and
use them frequently on touching desks, chairs etc.
4. Social Distancing - Parents are requested to keep their wards in their cars and await their
turn for entry maintaining norms of social distancing. In case of pickup of students,
parents/ drivers are to remain seated inside vehicles while they wait for their wards. Social
distancing of min. 2 meters is to be maintained at all times. Classrooms have been
organized with 6 feet distancing & exam rooms with 2 mtrs distance. Laboratories are also
allowing only 8 -9 students for this reason.
5. Separate Entries have been organized as fewer students will be attending school at a time.
As they will be seated at 6 feet distance, in classrooms, the desired distance will be
maintained.
